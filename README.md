# Speech-to-Command---ProductionEsque-Code
turned my customizable dictation software prototype into production software. this is most of the code for it.

summary: i created this software to save programmers with RSI and other hand disabilities from career-crippling injuries.
it is a dictation software with customizable libraries to allow programmers to type with their voice instead of their hands.

motivation: i used to have severe RSI from poor typing practices, and was typing with chopsticks at my lowest point. this software allows me to code when my RSI flares up.

technical: this software was built with java, javascript, and php for comining the two with a tcp socket.
